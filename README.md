This project is a basic working example of a VSCode C/C++ config to compile and debug a [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) project for the Nintendo DS.

This is configured to work on Linux.

If you're using Windows, just the instances of **/opt/** with **C:\** ( the install location of devkitPro ).


for more information, please check out the repos mentioned above, they explain it better than I can.
